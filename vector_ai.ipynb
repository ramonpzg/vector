       "The research was about the effects of taking part in exercise constantly or making it a habit in the population of children and teens that are severing from the genetic condition cystic Fibrosis.\n",
       "What is  Cystic Fibrosis\n",
       "It is a genetic condition, affecting lungs and digestion. Unfortunately, there is no cure. The condition Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is mostly inherited in the white population with 1 in every 3300 live births being diagnosed with the condition.[1]\n",
       "\n",
       "Where is the research from ?[edit | edit source]\n",
       "This research was based in the American Children’s hospital Pittsburgh in the CF centre. Volunteers for this research included siblings, friends and hospital employee’s children who did not have the condition. Two authors of this research work within the department as paediatrics and others have conducted research regarding children with CF. This included David Michael Orenstein who has many publications on CF. These authors have also conducted other research on children with CF with methods of exercise that can help combat the condition.[2]\n",
       "\n",
       "What kind of research was this?[edit | edit source]\n",
       "This was a meta-analysis form of research; even though this kind of research is time consuming the results are valid and reliable. Other studies that have been done have very similar results, regarding the effects of physical activity and the benefits it has on children and adolescents with CF. For an example, a study that was conducted in Austria compared the effects of physical activity versus chest physiotherapy which is popular within the CF community.[3] Two of the authors, David Michael and Patricia from the research article have conducted a study of “The prognostic value of exercise testing in patients with CF”.[2] Also, the Journal of Paediatric Pulmonology had similar conclusions that through exercise there is an improvement in oxygen consumption and physical self-efficiency and appearance in patients. As well as, lots of positive changes in living conditions of the patients.[4] Even though the research method used in these three studies differ, they all have very similar conclusions that exercise is beneficial for children with CF.\n",

       "30 people in the control not affected (17 male, 13 female )[5]\n",
       "The participants completed a Questionnaire about their activity levels. Children 12 years and older completed it with no help or little assistant. Children 12 years and under did it with a parent or guardian. \n",
       "When getting tested the children did 2 types of tests, a Pulmonary Function test, and an Exercise Test. The level of aerobic fitness was tested by the participant completing a progressive exercise test on a stationary electronic bike (cycle ergometer) using the Godfrey protocol. Oxygen uptake was measured using a cart that you breathed into and then It  analysed the breath content. This was recorded during the last 15 seconds of each stage exercise\n",
       "\n",
       "Pulmonary Function testing[edit | edit source]\n",
       "Pulmonary function was tested before exercising. Children who have CF had limited experience in doing these tests as they did not have regular exposure to the test due to the condition. A spirometry was used to measure pulmonary lung function capacity. The aim of the test is to measure how much and how quickly an individual is able to move air out of their lungs” ([6] this is done by breathing into a mouth piece connected to a device that records the air and it called a spirometer.\n",

       "Pros / Cons of this test[edit | edit source]\n",
       "This study was very good for testing but there were disadvantages on the younger population in the study due to being short as they were  unable to reach the pedals. Another limitation of the study is that focus was only on the effects of aerobic training and did not take into account the benefit of anaerobic or resistance training can have on an individual. Also, the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Council suggest that core strength is also an important component of helping with the clearance of mucus for patients[1]\n",

    "Recommendation systems can come in many different forms and sizes. We can create a system that takes into account the behaviour of other users, or a system that only looks at similar articles or items to make a recommendation. Both are powerful systems and could cover an entire book in their own right, which is why we will focus on the latter category, the one that makes recommendations based on similar articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create our recommendation system we first need to convert our articles into a numerical representation. We do this with a so-called bag of words (bow). BOWs are matrices with the documents in the rows, the terms contained in all documents along the columns, and the frequency with which each term appears in each document along the values. To create this kind of representation we can use `sklearn`'s `CountVectorizer` or `TfidfVectorizer` classes. The latter being the normalized version of the former, i.e. the frequency of a word divided by the amount of documents in which it appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use this classes we first instantiate them, fit the data to them so that they can learn the vocabulary of our corpus, and then we tranform the corpus into a sparse matrix. These sparse matrices hold the location of all non-zero values to make it easier to store the data and compute on it."

    "What is topic modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "> \"In machine learning and natural language processing, a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract \"topics\" that occur in a collection of documents. Topic modeling is a frequently used text-mining tool for discovery of hidden semantic structures in a text body. Intuitively, given that a document is about a particular topic, one would expect particular words to appear in the document more or less frequently: \"dog\" and \"bone\" will appear more often in documents about dogs, \"cat\" and \"meow\" will appear in documents about cats, and \"the\" and \"is\" will appear approximately equally in both.\" ~ [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model)\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the recommendation engine, topic modeling requires a bag of words for the representation of the data and, in contrast, it requires a topic number as the key parameter for the model."
